            <h1>The Biography of Alan Turing</h1>
            <p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology 
                and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.
                During World War II, he was part of a top-secret group of codebreakers who helped to break the German Enigma machine.
                 This codebreaking work significantly helped the Allies to win the war â€“ especially the naval war in the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>After the war, Turing continued his work on computers and artificial intelligence. He developed the concept of a universal machine that could be programmed 
                to carry out any computation that could be done by a human being. He also proposed the Turing test, which is still used today to determine whether a machine 
                can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.</p>
